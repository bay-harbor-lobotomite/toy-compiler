a toy compiler for (hopefully) a subset of the C programming language/C-like language of my own making.
# Project so far
- Implemented a small free-format scanner in C++. Not using lex or any other lexical analyzer generator because it was probably faster to implement by hand than learning the specification format idk.
- Setup bison to go with the project, written a small grammar that parses and prints simple expressions. Plan on writing a complete grammar and write my own recursive descent parser because why tf not.
